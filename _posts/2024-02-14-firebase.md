Ever wonder why JSON databases became so popular? Ultimately it was
their simplicity that won over developers. JSON databases let you put
your objects straight into the database without worrying about
schemas. Plus, if your app runs without a server, everything you need
is right there on the client, synced and ready to go at your
fingertips.

But there's a catch, or at least two pretty big catches. First, the
query language often leaves much to be desired. Second, you find
yourself constantly making trips to the server, making your app slow
and pretty much useless when you're offline.

But what if you could keep all your data local, always in-sync, and easily
queryable with SQL? Well, you can, and it's surprisingly simple with
SKDB. We'll use Firebase for our example, but the same approach works
with any JSON database (like Mongo). Let's jump in!

## Getting Started

First, the setup. We need to connect to Firebase and get everything
ready. We've even set up a demo database specifically for this
walkthrough (the whole code is available [here](https://github.com/SkipLabs/firebase-skdb)).

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getDatabase, ref, onValue } from "firebase/database";
import { createSkdb } from "skdb";

const firebaseConfig = {
  databaseURL: "https://skdb-demo-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

## Data Ingestion

Next, we'll create an SKDB instance and feed it our JSON data that
came from Firebase. SKDB is a SQL database that runs directly in your
browser. It's compiled to WASM, you can find the source code
[here](https://github.com/SkipLabs/skdb).

```javascript
const skdb = await createSkdb();

await skdb.exec("CREATE TABLE json_products (v JSON);");

const db = getDatabase();
const dbRef = ref(db, '/');

let data = await new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  onValue(dbRef, (snapshot) => resolve(snapshot.val()))
);

await skdb.insertMany('json_products',
  data.map(x => { return {v: JSON.stringify(x)}; })
);
```

## Inspecting the Data

So far, we've dumped a bunch of JSON into an SQL table. But before we
dive deeper, let's see what our data looks like. Let's run the classic
`SELECT * ...` query.

```javascript
console.log(await skdb.exec(`SELECT * FROM json_products LIMIT 10`));
```

The result looks like this:

```
  {
    v: '{"brand": "Al Munakh", "category": "fragrances", "description": "Original Al Munakh\\u00ae by Mahal Al Musk | Our Impression of Climate | 6ml Non-Alcoholic Concentrated Perfume Oil", "discountPercentage": 15.6, "id": "14", "images": ["https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/1.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/2.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/3.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/thumbnail.jpg"], "price": 120, "rating": 4.21, "stock": 114, "thumbnail": "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Non-Alcoholic Concentrated Perfume Oil"}'
  },
  {
    v: '{"brand": "AmnaMart", "category": "furniture", "description": "Material: Stainless Steel and Fabric Item Size: 110 cm x 45 cm x 175 cm Package Contents: 1 Storage Wardrobe", "discountPercentage": 7.98, "id": "35", "images": ["https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/1.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/2.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/3.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/4.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/thumbnail.jpg"], "price": 41, "rating": 4.06, "stock": 68, "thumbnail": "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/thumbnail.jpg", "title": "3 DOOR PORTABLE"}'
  },
...
```

It looks like a list of products, with their description. If you are
like me, you probably have spent too many hours of your life stairing
at JSON, wondering what actually is in there. Fortunately, we have a
solution. You can use `json_infer_schema` to infer the type of any
JSON column (the function `json_schema_pretty` makes the result more
readable).

```javascript
console.log((await skdb.exec(`
  SELECT json_schema_pretty(json_infer_schema(v)) AS schema
    FROM json_products
`))[0].schema
);
```

The result:

```
  {
    "brand": string,
    "category": string,
    "description": string,
    "discountPercentage": int | float,
    "id": string,
    "images": [string],
    "price": int,
    "rating": int | float,
    "stock": int,
    "thumbnail": string,
    "title": string
  }
```

Now, we get a clear view of our data, showing us details like brand,
category, description, and more. Even though most of the data is
straightforward, there's some structure to it, the `images` field uses
an array: that's something we will have to change if we want our data
to be easily queryable in SQL.

## Making JSON Data SQL-Friendly

Next, we transform this data into SQL using
`json_extract`. `json_extract`, given a pattern, produces an SQL table
with all the matching data. For example `{email<string>}` will extract
the content of the field email if it is a string. `%.email: v` will
extract all the field called "email" regardless of their type or depth
etc ... You can find the docs
[here](https://www.skdb.io/json_extract/).

Also, `json_extract` is always defined in a **reactive view**, one of
a core concepts of SKDB.  A **reactive view** is a special kind of
view that is always maintained up-to-date by the database, in the
following example, any change in the `json_product` table will be
reflected in the view `products`.

With that in mind, let's create a reactive view for our products.

```javascript
await skdb.exec(`
  CREATE REACTIVE VIEW products AS
    json_extract(
      json_products,
      v,
      '{
         id<string>,
         brand<string>,
         title<string>,
         category<string>,
         price<int>,
         rating<num>
       }'
  );
`);
```

Passed this point, we have an SQL table called `products` that we can
query in SQL like any other table! Let's add a couple of indexes to
speed things up.

```javascript
await skdb.exec("CREATE UNIQUE INDEX pk_products ON products(id);");
await skdb.exec("CREATE INDEX products_category ON products(category);");
```

For images, we will need a more complicated pattern. Since images are
stored in arrays, we need to "flatten" them to make them SQL
friendly. Concretely, we need to turn `{id: 23, ["image1", "image2"]}`
into two separate entries: `23, "image1"` and `23,
"image2"`. Fortunately, `json_extract` has a construction to do just
that, it consists in using `[]` after a field name.

```javascript
await skdb.exec(`
  CREATE REACTIVE VIEW images AS 
    json_extract(
      json_products,
      v,
      '{
         id<string>,
         thumbnail<string>,
         images[]:image<string>
       }'
    )
`);
```

And just like that, we have two SQL views: `products` and `images`. We
can search them like we would any other SQL table, or add indexes to
them. But there's more! SKDB's reactive nature lets you create any
number of reactive views directly in SQL: defining a client-side data
layer has never been easier!

## Client-side data layer

For example, creating a view for top-rated products:

```javascript
await skdb.exec(`
  CREATE REACTIVE VIEW top_products AS
    SELECT * from products ORDER BY rating DESC LIMIT 10;
`);
```

And if SQL isn't your thing? Guess what? You don't even need to dive
deep into SQL these days, thanks to AI. When your queries start
getting complex, chatGPT can write them for you.

Here's how you do it: just use the `skdb.schema('products')`
function. It'll spit out an SQL table structure that matches your
'products' view. Check out the output below:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE products (
  id TEXT NOT NULL,
  brand TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  price INTEGER NOT NULL,
  rating FLOAT NOT NULL
);
```

With this structure, writing a prompt for ChatGPT is a breeze. For
example:

```
Given an SQL table created as follows:
CREATE TABLE products (
  id TEXT NOT NULL,
  brand TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  price INTEGER NOT NULL,
  rating FLOAT NOT NULL
);
Can you generate an SQL query to find the top 10 highest-rated brands?
```

And the result is exactly what we asked for:

```sql
SELECT brand, AVG(rating) AS average_rating
  FROM products
  GROUP BY brand
  ORDER BY average_rating DESC
  LIMIT 10;
```

## Watching for Changes

When building reactive applications, it's essential to respond to
database changes in real-time. SKDB simplifies this process by
providing a straightforward method to watch for changes in any SQL
query. The `watchChanges` function allows you to define custom
behavior for handling initial data loads, additions, and
removals. This feature is particularly useful for applications that
require real-time data updates, such as dashboards, live feeds, or any
system that relies on the latest information.

Here's an example of how to use `skdb.watchChanges`:

```javascript
await skdb.watchChanges(
  "SELECT * FROM products",
  {},
  (initialRows) => {
    // Handle the initial set of rows
    console.log("Initial data:", initialRows);
  },
  (added, removed) => {
    // Efficiently manage additions
    added.forEach(row => {
      console.log("ADDED:", JSON.stringify(row));
    });

    // Handle removals with care
    removed.forEach(row => {
      console.log("REMOVED:", JSON.stringify(row));
    });
  }
);
```

This approach ensures that your application remains efficient and
responsive, only reacting to changes that directly affect your
dataset.

## Simplifying Reactivity with `useQuery`

For developers working within the React ecosystem, managing state and
reactivity can sometimes become cumbersome, especially when dealing
with external data sources like databases. SKDB addresses this
challenge with the `useQuery` hook, part of `skdb-react`, designed to
seamlessly integrate SQL queries into your React components. This hook
automatically refreshes your component whenever the underlying data
changes, ensuring that your UI is always in sync with your database.

Integrating `useQuery` is straightforward and significantly simplifies
data management:

```javascript
const products = useQuery("SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10");
// The component automatically updates when one of the first 10 products changes
```

This pattern not only reduces boilerplate code but also encapsulates
the complexity of data fetching and synchronization, allowing you to
focus on building your application's core features.

## Tying it all together

Finally, we need to watch the changes coming from Firebase to have a
real end-to-end reactive experience. You can use the `onSnapshot`
primitive to listen to the changes and have them reflected in
SKDB. But also the other way around, you can watch for the local
changes (using the primitive `watchChanges`) and have them reflected
in Firebase. Since this code is not very hard to write, and somewhat
application specific, we leave that as an exercise to the reader ;)

# Conclusion

Leveraging the power of JSON databases like Firebase alongside a tool
like SKDB can dramatically enhance your application's data handling
capabilities. By combining the flexibility of JSON with the robust
querying capabilities of SQL, you can create a highly responsive,
efficient, and dynamic application that stays in sync across all user
interactions.

Embrace the future, embrace reactive programming and see how it
transforms your application development process!
