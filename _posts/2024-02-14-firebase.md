Have you ever wondered why JSON databases became so popular?
Ultimately, it was their simplicity that won over developers. JSON
databases let you put your objects straight into the database without
worrying about schemas. Plus, if your app runs without a server then
everything you need is right there on the client, synced and ready to
go at your fingertips.

But, JSON databases come with at least two pretty big catches. First,
the query language often leaves much to be desired. Second, you find
yourself constantly making trips to the server, making your app slow
and pretty much useless when you're offline.

What if you could keep all your data local, always in-sync, and easily
queryable with SQL? Well, you can, and it's surprisingly simple with
[SKDB](skdb.io). We'll use Firebase for our example, but the same
approach works with any JSON database (like Mongo). Let's jump in!

## Getting Started

First, we need to set up and connect to Firebase and get everything
ready. We've even set up a demo database specifically for this
walkthrough (the whole code is available [here](https://github.com/SkipLabs/firebase-skdb)).

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getDatabase, ref, onValue } from "firebase/database";
import { createSkdb } from "skdb";

const firebaseConfig = {
  databaseURL: "https://skdb-demo-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

## Data Ingestion

Let's get the data we care about out of Firebase.


```javascript
const db = getDatabase();
const dbRef = ref(db, '/');

let data = await new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
  onValue(dbRef, (snapshot) => resolve(snapshot.val()))
);

```

And ingest it into SKDB.

```javascript
const skdb = await createSkdb();
await skdb.exec("CREATE TABLE json_products (v JSON);");
await skdb.insertMany('json_products',
  data.map(x => { return {v: JSON.stringify(x)}; })
);
```

## Inspecting the Data

So far, we've dumped a bunch of JSON into an SQL table. Before we
dive deeper, let's see what our data looks like. Let's run the classic
`SELECT * ...` query.

```javascript
await skdb.exec(`SELECT * FROM json_products LIMIT 10`)
```

The result looks like this:

```
  {
    v: '{"brand": "Al Munakh", "category": "fragrances", "description": "Original Al Munakh\\u00ae by Mahal Al Musk | Our Impression of Climate | 6ml Non-Alcoholic Concentrated Perfume Oil", "discountPercentage": 15.6, "id": "14", "images": ["https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/1.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/2.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/3.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/thumbnail.jpg"], "price": 120, "rating": 4.21, "stock": 114, "thumbnail": "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/14/thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Non-Alcoholic Concentrated Perfume Oil"}'
  },
  {
    v: '{"brand": "AmnaMart", "category": "furniture", "description": "Material: Stainless Steel and Fabric Item Size: 110 cm x 45 cm x 175 cm Package Contents: 1 Storage Wardrobe", "discountPercentage": 7.98, "id": "35", "images": ["https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/1.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/2.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/3.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/4.jpg", "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/thumbnail.jpg"], "price": 41, "rating": 4.06, "stock": 68, "thumbnail": "https://cdn.dummyjson.com/product-images/35/thumbnail.jpg", "title": "3 DOOR PORTABLE"}'
  },
...
```

It looks like a list of products, with their description. If you are
like me, you have probably spent too many hours of your life staring
at JSON, wondering what is actually in there. Fortunately, SKDB offers
a solution. You can use `json_infer_schema` to infer the type of any
JSON column (the function `json_schema_pretty` formats the result to
be more human-readable).

```javascript
(await skdb.exec(`
  SELECT json_schema_pretty(json_infer_schema(v)) AS schema
    FROM json_products
`)).scalarValue()
```

The result:

```
  {
    "brand": string,
    "category": string,
    "description": string,
    "discountPercentage": int | float,
    "id": string,
    "images": [string],
    "price": int,
    "rating": int | float,
    "stock": int,
    "thumbnail": string,
    "title": string
  }
```

Now, we get a clear view of our data, showing us details like brand,
category, description, and more. Even though most of the data is
straightforward, it does have some structure: the `images` field uses
an array, which we will have to change if we want our data
to be easily queryable in SQL.

## Making JSON Data SQL-Friendly

Next, we transform this data into SQL using
`json_extract`. `json_extract`, given a pattern, produces an SQL table
with all the matching data. For example, `{email<string>}` will extract
the content of the field email if it is a string. `%.email: v` will
extract all fields called "email" regardless of their type or location
in the input JSON's structure. You can find the docs
[here](https://www.skdb.io/json_extract/).


Also, `json_extract` is always defined in a **reactive view**, one of
the core concepts of SKDB.  A **reactive view** is a special kind of
view that is always maintained up-to-date by the database. In the
following example, any change in the `json_product` table will be
reflected in the view `products`.

With that in mind, let's create a reactive view for our products.

```javascript
await skdb.exec(`
  CREATE REACTIVE VIEW products AS
    json_extract(
      json_products,
      v,
      '{
         id<string>,
         brand<string>,
         title<string>,
         category<string>,
         price<int>,
         rating<num>
       }'
  );
`);
```

Past this point, we have an SQL table called `products` that we can
query in SQL like any other table! Let's add a couple of indexes to
speed things up.

```javascript
await skdb.exec("CREATE UNIQUE INDEX pk_products ON products(id);");
await skdb.exec("CREATE INDEX products_category ON products(category);");
```

For images, we will need a more complicated pattern. Since images are
stored in arrays, we need to "flatten" them to make them SQL
friendly. Concretely, we want to convert JSON like `{id: 23, ["image1", "image2"]}`
into two separate SQL rows: `23, "image1"` and `23, "image2"`.
Fortunately, `json_extract` has a construction to do just that by
appending `[]` to a field name.

```javascript
await skdb.exec(`
  CREATE REACTIVE VIEW images AS 
    json_extract(
      json_products,
      v,
      '{
         id<string>,
         thumbnail<string>,
         images[]:image<string>
       }'
    )
`);
```

Just like that, we have two SQL views: `products` and `images`. We
can search them like we would any other SQL table, or add indexes to
them. SKDB's reactive nature lets you create any number of reactive
views directly in SQL: defining a client-side data layer has never
been easier!

## Client-side data layer

Reactive views are at the core of SKDB. You are going to use them
whenever you want a specific view to be maintained up-to-date by the
database. For example, let's create a view for top-rated products:

```javascript
await skdb.exec(`
  CREATE REACTIVE VIEW top_products AS
    SELECT * from products ORDER BY rating DESC LIMIT 10;
`);
```

Every time the underlying data changes, SKDB will update this view,
and it will do so incrementally (without ever re-running the query
from scratch). That completely changes how you should think about your
data. You can create layers and layers of views that contain exactly
what you need.

For example, imagine you want to be able to search for categories and
sort the result by average product rating.

You would first create a reactive view:

```javascript
await skdb.exec(`
  CREATE REACTIVE VIEW category_by_rating AS
    SELECT category, avg(rating) as average_rating
    FROM products
    ORDER BY average_rating
`);
```

You can now search categories very efficiently, with queries as simple as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM category_by_rating WHERE ...
```

## Watching for Changes

When building reactive applications, it's essential to respond to
changing data in real-time. SKDB simplifies this process by
providing a straightforward method to watch for changes in any SQL
query. The `watchChanges` function allows you to define custom
behavior for handling initial data loads, additions, and
removals. This feature is particularly useful for applications that
require real-time data updates, such as dashboards, live feeds, or any
system that relies on the latest information.

Here's an example of how to use `skdb.watchChanges`:

```javascript
await skdb.watchChanges(
  "SELECT * FROM products",
  {},
  (initialRows) => {
    // Handle the initial set of rows
    console.log("Initial data:", initialRows);
  },
  (added, removed) => {
    // Efficiently manage additions
    added.forEach(row => {
      console.log("ADDED:", JSON.stringify(row));
    });

    // Handle removals with care
    removed.forEach(row => {
      console.log("REMOVED:", JSON.stringify(row));
    });
  }
);
```

This approach ensures that your application remains efficient and
responsive, only reacting to changes that directly affect your
dataset.

## Simplifying Reactivity with `useQuery`

For developers working within the React ecosystem, managing state and
reactivity can sometimes become cumbersome, especially when dealing
with external data sources like databases. SKDB addresses this
challenge with the `skdb-react` library and its `useQuery` hook, which
is designed to seamlessly integrate SQL queries into your React
components. This hook automatically refreshes your component whenever
the underlying data changes, ensuring that your UI is always in sync.

Integrating `useQuery` is straightforward and significantly simplifies
data management:

```javascript
const products = useQuery("SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10");
// The component automatically updates when one of the first 10 products changes
```

This pattern not only reduces boilerplate code but also encapsulates
the complexity of data fetching and synchronization, allowing you to
focus on building your application's core features.

## Tying it all together

Finally, we need to watch the changes coming from Firebase to have a
real end-to-end reactive experience. You can use the `onSnapshot`
primitive to listen for Firebase changes and have them reflected in
SKDB. In the other direction, you can watch for local changes (using
the primitive `watchChanges`) and communicate them to Firebase. Since
this code is not very hard to write and somewhat application specific,
we leave that as an exercise to the reader ;)

# Conclusion

Leveraging the power of JSON databases like Firebase alongside a tool
like SKDB can dramatically enhance your application's data handling
capabilities. By combining the flexibility of JSON with the robust
querying capabilities of SQL, you can create a highly responsive,
efficient, and dynamic application that stays in sync across all user
interactions.

Embrace the future, embrace reactive programming and see how it
transforms your application development process!
